# Actions

Action is a request sent to RESTful API application. Use `##` to define an action in a test case.

## Request Body

Some action may need to send a body to the server, like `POST`. Use code block, ~```~ or `~~~`, to declare the request body. Code block with language annotated is acceptable.

## Request Headers

Header of the request can be defined in a 2-columned table with title of `Header` and `Value`.

## Files Upload

Use bullet list for perform files upload. File name must be stated in anchor link. Field name is corresponding label.

## Example

~~~
## POST /todos

| Header | Value |
| - | - |
| Content-Type | application/json |
| Authorization | Bearer some-token |

```
{
    "title": "Buy milk"
}
```
~~~

The above example is equivalent to the following HTTP request:

```
POST /todos HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer some-token

{
    "title": "Buy milk"
}
```

## Example Code Block with Annotated Language

~~~
## POST /todos

| Header | Value |
| - | - |
| Content-Type | application/json |
| Authorization | Bearer some-token |

```json
{
    "title": "Buy milk"
}
```

~~~
## POST /media/photo
